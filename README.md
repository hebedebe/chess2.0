New chess update!!

CHESS RULES!!!!
1. rolling a d4 determines the number of moves
	a. if a player rolls a 1 three times in a row (on a d4) , on their next turn they are allowed to roll a d12
	b. if a player puts the opposing king into check then they forfeit the rest of their moves for that turn
	c. if a 4 is rolled on the first move, it must be rerolled

2. Castling is permitted at any time as long as there is nothing between the king and the rook
	a. any player may castle out of check, or into a position in which the king is not threatened
		aa. if the rook is threatened, it may be moved 2 squares in any non-diagonal direction
			aaa. if a player's king is put in check by this action, and is still in check by the end of the turn, the opposing player wins by checkmate.

3. If an en-passant is a possible move, it must be done.
	a. if a player is in check and they have the opportunity to perform an en-passant (even if the king would remain in check), it is counted as a checkmate

4. if a pawn is prevented from advancing by a piece directly in front of them, and it can make no other moves, it can swap positions with that piece.
	a. if the piece being moved is a king, queen or rook then the pawn is taken
	b. pawns may not do this to other pawns
		ba. if 2 pawns of each colour occupy a 2x2 space, a revolution is staged and both players lose their kings (the game does not end). Instead of checkmate, a player now wins by taking all of their opponent's pawns.
			baa. If a pawn is promoted, and the promoting player has no king, the pawn becomes a king and the opposing player's win condition returns to checkmate.
		bb. pawns may now take other pawns in the same way pieces are taken in checkers.
			bba. this behaviour is stopped if either player gets their king back.

5. A bishop may not take another bishop that was on the same diagonal as it when the turn started.
