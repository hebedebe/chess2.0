New chess update!!
<br><br><br>
1. rolling a d3 determines the number of moves <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. if a player rolls a 1 three times in a row (on a d3) , on their next turn they are allowed to roll a d12<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. if a player puts the opposing king into check then they forfeit the rest of their moves for that turn<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. if a 4 is rolled on the first move, it must be rerolled
<br><br>
2. Castling is permitted at any time as long as there is nothing between the king and the rook, provided they are both on the same outer edge of the board<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. any player may castle out of check, or into a position in which the king is not threatened<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aa. if the rook is threatened, it may be moved 2 squares in any non-diagonal direction<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aaa. if a player's king is put in check by this action, and is still in check by the end of the turn, the opposing player wins by checkmate.
<br><br>
3. If an en-passant is a possible move, it must be done.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. if a player is in check and they have the opportunity to perform an en-passant (even if the king would remain in check), it is counted as a checkmate
<br><br>
4. if a pawn is prevented from advancing by a piece directly in front of them, and it can make no other moves, it can swap positions with that piece.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. if the piece being moved is a king, queen or rook then the pawn is taken<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. pawns may not do this to other pawns<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ba. if 2 pawns of each colour occupy a 2x2 space, a revolution is staged and both players lose their kings (the game does not end). Instead of checkmate, a player now wins by taking all of their opponent's pawns.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baa. If a pawn is promoted, and the promoting player has no king, the pawn becomes a king and the opposing player's win condition returns to checkmate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bb. pawns may now take other pawns in the same way pieces are taken in checkers.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bba. this behaviour is stopped if either player gets their king back.
<br><br>
5. A bishop may not take another bishop that was on the same diagonal as it when the turn started.
<br><br>
6. Each player has a BLOOD counter, that, should it reach 0, causes that player to lose the game.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Taking an opponent's piece increases your BLOOD counter proportionally with the piece that was taken
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Taking your own pieces (except the king) can be done in exchange for 2.5x the BLOOD that the piece is worth.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If a player rolls a 3 twice in a row, they lose a quarter of their BLOOD
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ca. This only occurs if the player have reached or surpassed 75% blood at any point during the game.
